<h2>Kyle's stolen pickeled egg recipe</h2>
<p>This is a recipe that has been in my family for one generation (this generation). I just stole it from another webpage this morning. I have never made this recipe so let me know if it's good or not.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<img src="../img/ingredients.webp" width="200" alt="A photo of all the ingredients in seperate containers">
<ul>
    <li>12-18 hard <strong>boiled eggs</strong></li>
    <li>4 cups distilled <strong>white vinegar</strong></li>
    <li>4 cups <strong>cold water</strong></li>
    <li>1 tablespoon <strong>sea salt</strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons <strong>peppercorns</strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons <strong>spice</strong></li>
    <li>1 teaspoon <strong>crushed pepper</strong></li>
    <li>6 <strong>garlic cloves</strong> (add extra if you wish or don't idgaf)</li>
    <li>5 <strong>jalapenos</strong> (1/4" slices)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>The method I like the best is to "steam boil" eggs. ü•öüç≥ Add water to a large pan with a lid, bring the water to a boil, and set a steamer basket in the water. Carefully add eggs to the steamer basket, cover, and let steam at high heat for 12 minutes. Fill a large bowl with ice and water.</li>
    <li>Remove eggs to ice bath for 15 minutes, roll crack on the board and the peel will slip RIGHT OFF! I love making eggs this way.</li>
    <li>Push a clean stainless fork into each egg, this helps brine get into the eggs. (Don't use any wooden items like toothpicks-it can be non-food-safe when pickling). Place all 12-18 eggs in a large clear and clean clamp jar.</li>
    <li>Next, slice the fresh jalapenos into ¬º" slices, and set them on top of the boiled eggs in your jar. </li>
